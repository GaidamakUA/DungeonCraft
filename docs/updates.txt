Ability, BaseClass, classes, races, spellgroups, and traits.

Some help file additions for the LogicBlock event.

31 August 2000 Paul Stevens
Fixed Drunken Chain in tavern event.  I think.

1 September 2000 Paul Stevens
The ItemKeyQuest dialog did not work in the 'standard'
way.  It edited globalData directly.  This had the effect of 
losing changes when prewssing OK and not discarding changes
when pressing Cancel.  
Explanation:  Global menu "edit keys",etc edited globalData
directly so that pressing Cancel did not Cancel the changes.
Global menu "Edit Settings" allowed you to change the keys
and quests in globalData but then overwrote them when you
pressed OK.
Also, event editing allowed globalData changes that could
not be "canceled".

I changed ItemKeyQuest dialog to operate on a copy
of the object and then the caller could "GetData" if 
"OK" is pressed.  It can also operate in a read-only mode
which seems more appropriate for the event editing.  The
"add", "Delete", and "Edit" keys are hidden.

2 September 2000 Paul Stevens
Implemented arithmetic plus- and minus-gates in LogicBlock event.

2 September 2000 Paul Stevens
Implemented NPC List as input to LogicBlock as a way of satisfying

9 September 2000 Paul Stevens
Do not save levelData.eventData in game save file.  The

there is no levelData to which the eventData can be applied.

9 September 2000 RTurner
Fixed editor SaveAs to make complete copy of design into new folder.

10 September 2000 RTurner
