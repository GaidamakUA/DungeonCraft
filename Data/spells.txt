// Total validation is performed when reading this data.
// Nothing you do can cause the program to crash.  It may spit

// The first item has an empty name and will be ignored.  You can

// Each line is of the form    name = value
//     value may be omitted.
//     eg:   
//       special abilities = 
//     This line will be interpreted as setting special abilities
//     to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in
//     many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.
//     
// White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can
// contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace
// are ignored.  So, for example:
//      attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//         attack bonus=3<cr>
// are equivalent.  But
//      attack    bonus = 3
//      attack bonus = 3
// are different.

// Lines starting with two slashes are comment lines.  Like me.

// Attribute names are case-insensitive.  
//   Name = Wimpy Axe
//   namE = Wimpy Axe
//   NAME = Wimpy Axe

// Text values retain their case.  Values with enumerated possibilities
// are case-insensitive.  Example  save result = HalF DaMAgE
//
// File names can use the UNIX syntax with slashes because the backslash

//
//  ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//
// Each spell is defined by the following fields:
//
// Name (text, required)
// Each spell must have a uniue name.  You may add a qualifier to a 
// name (separated with a vertical bar) to make it unique.  For example:
//    Dimwittify
//    Dimwittify|sorta
//    Dimwittify|really
//
// The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The qualifier 
// is discarded when the binary files for the design are created.  But
// the unique name is necessary during the design stage to allow unambiguous
// references to the spells.  During gameplay they are identified by a
// binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion between the three Dimwittifies
// even though they are all printed as 'Dimwittify'.
//
/// default is all blanks which makes the entire spell a comment
// eg:     name = subliminal flash
//
// Cast Msg (text)
//   This is the text displayed when the spell is cast. You can substitute
//   the names of the target, caster, and spell by using /t, /c, and /s
//   default is none
//   eg: /c blasts /t with /s
//
// Casting sound (file name, or "none", or "Default")
// default is default spell sound
// eg:     c:\\sounds/zap.wav
//

// eg:     c:\\sounds/zap.wav
//

// Linger sound (file name, or "none", or "Default")
// default is default cast sound

//
// class (MU, Cleric)
// Only one class allowed
// this determines which school of magic the spell belongs to
// default = MU

//
// cast by (MU, Cleric, Ranger, Fighter, Thief, Paladin, Druid)
// Combine multiple classes using the + sign
// Only MagicUsers can cast spells from the MagicUser school
// MagicUsers cannot cast spells from the cleric school
// Default = value of 'class' (which defaults to MU)
// The following example creates a spell that can only be cast by
// clerics and rangers. Also, 'Class = Cleric' should preceed this.
// eg: cast by = Cleric + Ranger 
// You can create spells that only Rangers can cast, which still belong
// to the cleric school, with
// eg: Cast By = Ranger

// Can party members memorize and cast this spell? If not, only monsters/NPCs can use it.
// default is yes
// eg:     usable by party = yes
//
// Can Scribe ( yes or no )
//  Should this spell be made available for scribing by MU at level change? 
//  eg:     can scribe = no
//
// Auto Scribe ( yes or no )
//  MagicUsers are automatically given spells with this property enabled when
//  they advance to a new level (or start anew at level 1)
//  default is no
//  eg:     auto scribe = no
//
// Save Versus ("Par/Pois/DM" or "Pet/Poly" or "Rod/Staff/Wand" or "spell" or "Breath Weapon"

// Spell Effect
// Specify which character attributes are modified by this spell. To modify multiple
// attributes, add multiple 'spell effect' lines.
//  
// Format:
// Attribute,Change Amount(diceplus format),Change Units,Targeting,Cumulative,Script1,Script2,Script3
//
//    Attribute = attribute keyword affected, such as $CHAR_THACO
//    Change Amount = how much to change attribute value, such as 1d4 + 1*level + 2
//           This is a signed number. To decrease the current value, use a
//           negative Change Amount.
//    Change Units = 'delta', 'percent', or 'absolute'.
//           Delta value is added to current value
//           Percent changes current value by given percentage
//           Absolute changes current value to given value
//    Targeting = 'target','targeter','alltargettypes'
//           target = affects spell target
//           targeter = affects whomever targets the spell target (combat only)
//           alltargettypes = all of the above
//    Cumulative = 'yes' or 'no', will this attribute change have affect if
//                 same attribute already modified from same or different spell?
//    Script1 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine if
//             spell will affect targets.
//    Script2 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine how
//              the Change Amount is modified based on current game data.
//    Script3 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine how
//              the saving throw of the spell target is modified based on current game data
//    Script4 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime - but only if the spell target
//              failed the saving throw.
//
//    Scripts are optional and can be left blank. However, if Script3 is used and the others
//    are not, placeholder commas must be used.
// Examples:
//  spell effect = $CHAR_AC, 1d4+2, delta, target, yes
//  spell effect = $CHAR_THACO, 1d6, percent, alltargettypes, no
//
//  next one shows Script1 and Script2 as being empty, while Script3 is not
//
//  spell effect = $CHAR_THACO, 1d6, percent, alltargettypes, no,,,$RETURN true;
