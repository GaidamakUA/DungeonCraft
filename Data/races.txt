// Adjustments are of the form:
//    +/-n*(characteristic-k)/d
// For example to adjust, say, height.  Any of these are legal and equivalent.
//   Height Adjust  =  +1*(Level-0)/1  ; Means (+1*(level-0))/1
//   Height Adjust  =   1*(Level-0)/1
//   Height Adjust  =   1*level/1
//   Height Adjust  =   level/1
//   Height Adjust  =   1*level
//   Height Adjust  =   level
// Division throws remainder away.  +1/2 = 0   -1/2 = 0
