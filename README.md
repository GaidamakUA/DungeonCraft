# DungeonCraft
Updated emulator of Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures

# About this version
It is version exported from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/uaf/). The code was in outdated CVS format so I decided I shoud convert it to GIT repositary. I plan to make it run on MacOS. Probably, continue development.

# Description
Dungeon Craft is an adventure creator that emulates the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Gold Box RPG's released by SSI. Initially designed to be a "more unlimited" version of the Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures (FRUA) game editor and engine, it has far surpassed the capabilities of the old FRUA system. The editor is used to configure art, items, monsters, spells, special abilities, classes and races.. Each adventure is self-contained and doesn't require the editor to be played.

The editor is extremely versatile and the databases are completely designer created allowing easy additions and modifications to spells, monsters, items, classes, races and special abilities, and are exportable to be easily shared with others or used in other designs.
