Dungeon Craft Design Info

This design requires several files to operate successfully. If you have not installed Dungeon Craft on your computer, and you are trying to play this design without success, you may be missing a required file. At the moment, only the Dungeon Craft executable is not included with each design. All art/sound files should be present.

The executable can be downloaded from the Dungeon Craft web site at:

http:\\uaf.sourceforge.net

in the 'Download' area.

You will need the Dungeon Craft engine, called UAFWin.exe. You can copy it into the design folder, or put it in a separate folder. The latter is best if you have several designs to play. If you put UAFWin.exe into a separate folder you will need to give it command line information that informs the engine which design folder to play. A Windows' shortcut can provide this, or you can use a DOS box. The syntax for command line is

UAFWin.exe <full path to design folder> 
(brackets not included)

example: UAFWin C:\TEMP\TestDesign.dsn

If the design name has spaces in it, such as "Temple of Doom.dsn", then you must enclose it with quotes like this

UAFWin "full path to design folder"

If you use a Windows' shortcut the working folder must have the path to the design folder.

If the engine cannot find the design you specified on the command line, or you do not specify a design, it will begin searching your hard drive for available designs. The designs it finds will be listed for you to select from, and you can simply choose a listed design and play it. Searching your hard drive is slow, so it is better if you provide the design name on the command line.

You can also download a utility that will list the available designs for you and automatically start the engine with the proper command line data. You can download this launch utility on the DC website.

If you still cannot get the design to play, you can email me for help at
